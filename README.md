# Code practice

A repository with small coding tasks for the Kotlin course:

- [functional programming](./src/main/kotlin/cub/fp)
- [parallel & concurrent programming](./src/main/kotlin/cub/concurrent)

In the folder with tasks you will find two nested folders: `tasks` and `answers`. 
The `tasks` folder contains several small tasks that should be done. 
These tasks illustrate different important aspects of the current topic.
The `answers` folder contains solutions for these tasks in Kotlin-like style - you can 
try to implement each task in your own way and next to check how this task can 
be implemented by using some Kotlin features.
